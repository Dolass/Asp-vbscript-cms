<p><strong>Quality page titles are the most important factor for acheiving good search engine rankings. </strong></p>
<p>The title tag is  the most important information provided to search engines that crawl and index your site. This short phrase is the &quot;tag line&quot; that litterally links a search engine results page to your site. Additionally, this phrase appears as the Window Title of your site visitors' web browser  and in their favorites list if the user decides to bookmark your page. Therefore you need to take this aspect of your quite seriously. Please use the following rules to define the title tags for each page of your site: </p>
<p><strong>Rules for designing a page title.</strong></p>
<ul><li>Each page should have a <em>unique</em> title. The search engines will get confused if you use the same title for various pages.</li>
  <li>The title is different than the &quot;Name&quot; of the page in that it is the subject of the page. It  is a short phrase that summarizes the content and describes the purpose of the page's existence.</li>
<li>Limit the title to  65 characters or less. Google will trim off the rest when they display your link in their search results page.</li>
<li>Contain important keywords in context of the page's content (more so than general site keywords). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consider the page’s content.</strong></p>
<p>Read the content for the current page and determine a short phrase that summarizes and describes your content. Be sure to include important page-specific keywords in this phrase. </p>
<p><strong>Target the searcher, not the search engine.</strong></p>
<p>Searchers not  only include the object of their search in their search phrases, but  also add words that relate to <em>why they are looking for it.</em> After  considering the basic subject of the page’s content, try to transpose the  phrase to include words that a searcher might use to search for that  kind of content. For example, if my page is about how database driven  websites are better than static pages my subject might be &quot;database  driven websites&quot;. That would be a correct and relevant phrase, but I  like to add a word or two that pre-suppose <em>the reason why</em> they  might be searching for this information. In this case I might add the  words &quot;advantages of&quot; to the phrase. I’ve found that </p>
