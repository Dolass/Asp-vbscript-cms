#  ===============================================================
#  This file contains a list of banner files to use for this site.
#  The format for specifying the list items is:
#
#         [file];[text];[link];[width]x[height]
#
#  "file" is the path to the banner image file, it may be a relative
#         path (beginning with a slash) or fully qualified URL (begin-
#         ning with http://).
#  "text" is an optional parameter that specifies the alternate text
#         that should appear when you hover over the image. If left
#         blank, an appropriate title such as the site name will be
#         used.
#  "link" is the url to redirect the user if he/she clicks the banner
#         image.  The url may be relative (beginning with a slash) or
#         absolute (beginning with http://) If the url is left blank,
#         the image will not be clickable.
#  "width" is the width of the file (this is required if the file is a
#         flash archive).
#  "height"is the height of the file (this is required if the file is
#         a flash archive). 
#   ;(semi-colon)  used to separate the three possible values.
#   #(numeral) used to signify lines in the file that should not be 
#         processed, for comments such as this ;)
